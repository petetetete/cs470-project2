## The EDGE class is just a utility class for the GraphViz and GraphMaker classes.  It simply represents an edge in
# a graph being constructed, capturing the endpoints of the edge as well as its label.  Its biggest active
# contribution is that it is able to compute the edge label based on some distortion percentage (between 0-1) that is
# passed into the constructor as the "label".

class Edge:

    # Makes a new edge.  You pass in two points (x,y tuples) plus a label.  Label is used flexibly to determine
    #  how the edge is labeled.   If label=0, then edge is just labeled with exact straightline distance between
    #  the points.  If label is a value between 0-1, this is viewed as a percentage to distort the distance by.
    #  If label > 1, then is taken as an actual value that you want placed on that edge.
